  Google Colab platform


- ## Utilization

1. **Select the file:**
 
    Go to ShivuXD/QR-Code-Generator and, click on the " QR - Code Generator.ipynb " file. Open it in your Google Colab.

2. **Run the Libraries:**
 
    Execute all the libaries, cell-by-cell.

3. **Upload your information:**

    When all libraries are imported and, executed. You shall upload your links, texts, etc to generate it's QR Code.

5. **Download the QR - Code:**

     The following generated QR - Code will be installed in your files folder in Google Colab in .png file.


   ## Script Explaination

   ### Libraries of Function

   This script uses `pyqrcode` and, `pypng` to run and, give user the generated QR - Code.

  `pyqrcode` Library is used here to generate QR - Codes and, QR Code related functions.
  `pypng` Library is used here to generate such QR - Codes in forms of images ( .png ) for user to store and, use it conveniently.

  ### Working
   This code generates a QR code from a user-provided link. It first installs the required libraries (`pyqrcode` and, `pypng`), then asks the user to enter a URL or, any text. The link is then converted into a QR code using pyqrcode.create(), and the QR code is saved as a PNG image named QR.png in the files of the user's platform.
   The QR Code can then be installed and, utilized as per user's purposes.


   # The Website
   
   I've also designed a real-time QR Generator website with the help of `v0.dev`, where users can customize their QR Codes as per their preferences for their utilization. The website is free for all and, requires no sign-up.
